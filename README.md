We have chosen to implement (1) a PID controller, (2) an LQR controller, and (3) a Luenberger Observer. 
We report the trends for our simulation results below:


Further, we give a brief comparative analysis:
The highest magnitude of the control input is greater for PID compared to LQR. 
Currently, PID performs slightly better than LQR in terms of the score for both sine and square waves. 
Both PID and LQR tend to do better for sine waves compared to square waves in terms of both tracking performance and energy cost.
